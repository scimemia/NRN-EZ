# NRN-EZ

**SYNOPSIS AND MOTIVATION**

NRN-EZ is a software that allows to distribute synaptic inputs onto digitally reconstructed neurons. With NRN-EZ, users can select the location, strength, and activation time of a population of synaptic inputs. These inputs can be in selected sub-cellular compartments, identified by the user or generated through NRN-EZ itself. The location, strength and activation time can be the same for all inputs or vary according to uniform or Poisson distributions. NRN-EZ provides an intuitive graphical user interface to generate code that can then be integrated with other .hoc files, typically used when running multi-compartmental models of synaptic integration and cell excitability using software like NEURON. This framework allows users to test mechanistic hypothesis quickly and accurately for further experimental validation, without necessarily having extensive background in the .hoc programming language.

**OVERVIEW**

NRN-EZ is an open-source software, able to generate output files that can then be used for running NEURON simulations. It has an intuitive interface that lowers the barrier for running computer simulations, especially in young trainees with minimal programming skills. NRN-EZ is compatible with Linux, Mac OS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. NRN-EZ was built using the Python language and the PyQt and PyQtGraph libraries. Source code and executable, standalone versions of NRN-EZ are available for Linux, Mac OS, and Microsoft Windows platforms.

Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS):
NRN_EZ_Linux

Microsoft Windows (Win 10):
NRN_EZ_Win

Mac OS (OS12, Monterey):
NRN_EZ_Mac

The Sample neurons folder contains an .swc file, a description of the settings used to control the spatial distribution and time of onset of multiple synaptic inputs, and the corresponding output file generated by NRN-EZ. 

**INSTALLATION FOR VERSION 1.0**

NRN-EZ requires the following languages and libraries:

•	Python 3.6.9
•	PyQt 5.10.1
•	PyQtGraph 0.11.0

Detailed instructions for software installation are provided in the Installation file in the Instructions folder. All required package files are in the Package files folder.

TESTS
To test NRN-EZ, load the .swc file containing the description of the cell morphology, which is in the Samples folder. Then, fill all fields that describe the spatiotemporal pattern of activation of the synaptic inputs and run the application according to the instructions described in the Instructions folder.
